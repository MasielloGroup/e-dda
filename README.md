# Electron Beam Driven Discrete Dipole Approximation

The following code is a modified verison of Draine's Discrete Dipole Approximation (DDA) code version 7.1. We have modified the code to to allow for an electron beam excitation source. The following code computs the electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS)) and angle-resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) for both aloof and internal geometries.
